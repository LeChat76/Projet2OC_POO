## Features
- Select only one category or all
- All data extracted to data\CSVs's folder
- All book cover downloaded on each subfolder data\[category] and named by the name of the book (easy way to find the good one)
- timestamp of the extracted CSV in the file name (in that way by relaunching the script all olds
extractions are keeped in the folder)

 - Create an log file for each using
 - Create a progress bar (when launching all categories it takes some times so I think it will be good to see where we are in the execution of the script)
